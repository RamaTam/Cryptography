Week 1 – Two Time Pad (Reusing Stream Cipher Keys)
-------------------------------

Problem:

“Let us see what goes wrong when a stream cipher key is used more than once. Below are eleven hex-encoded ciphertexts that are the result of encrypting eleven plaintexts with a stream cipher, all with the same stream cipher key. Your goal is to decrypt the last ciphertext, and submit the secret message within it as solution. ”

Week 1 – Problem Set Question 7
-------------------------------

Suppose you are told that the one time pad encryption of the message “attack at dawn” is 6c73d5240a948c86981bc294814d (the plaintext letters are encoded as 8-bit ASCII and the given ciphertext is written in hex). What would be the one time pad encryption of the message “attack at dusk” under the same OTP key?
